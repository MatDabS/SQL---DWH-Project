## üîç Project Overview
<p>This project is divided into two parts.</p>
<p>First part showcases the process of building data warehouse, covering full road from raw CSV data files up to developing structured fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.</p>

 - <strong>Data Architecture</strong>: This data warehouse uses Medallion Architecture, containing three (Bronze, Silver, Gold) layers.
 - <strong>ETL process</strong>: Extracting, transforming and loading data from source into consecutive warehouse layers.
 - <strong>Data Modeling</strong>: Developing prepared for data analysis fact and dimension tables.

Second part demonstrates advanced techniques frequently used by professional data analytics and brings up final reports about customers and products in the business.
 - <strong>Analytics & Reporting</strong>: Creating SQL-based reports for actionable insights.

## üèõÔ∏è Data Architecture
<p>Project follows <strong>Medallion Architecture</strong> with <strong>Bronze</strong>, <strong>Silver</strong> and <strong>Gold</strong> layers: </p>

 - <strong>Bronze Layer</strong>: Stores raw data, as-is from source systems. Data is loaded from CSV files into the SQL Server Database with stored procedure. No transformations are performed.
 - <strong>Silver Layer</strong>: This layer includes data cleansing, standarization and normalization processes in order to prepare data for analysis. Data is loaded from Bronze layer into Silver layer with stored procedure. 
 - <strong>Gold Layer</strong>: Contains business-ready data modeled into star schema prepared for analysis. Data is stored in views.
 
## üìå Project Requirements
### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
<strong>Objective</strong>: Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate data and prepare it for analytical reporting and infromed decision-making.

<strong>Specifications</strong>:
 - <strong>Data Sources</strong>: Import data from two source systems (CRM and ERP) provided as CSV files.
 - <strong>Data Quality</strong>: Cleanse and normalize data resolving its quality issues prior to analysis.
 - <strong>Integration</strong>: Combine both sources into single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical reporting.
 - <strong>Scope</strong>: Focus on the latest dataset only, historization is not required.
 - <strong>Documentation</strong>: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support further users of data warehouse.

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)
<strong>Objective</strong>: Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights about the business.
 - <strong>Customer Behaviour</strong>
 - <strong>Product Performance</strong>
 - <strong>Sales Trends</strong>
 
These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics.
